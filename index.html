  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s October again (and a few days into it but we&rsquo;ll pretend I didn&rsquo;t just think this up) and that means
it&rsquo;s <em>Cybersecurity Awareness</em> month which is perhaps becoming one of my favourite months of the year now. So,
in light of this fact and the fact that this is actually my first blog post here, I wanted to share a few
helpful ideas, suggestions, and hints to be more security-aware both at home and at work (if you work using a
computer or work from home)!</p>

<h2>Disclaimer:</h2>

<p>I am by no means an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; especially in a commercial setting. Therefore, it is imperitive that if you are viewing
this information and want to implement this is your work environment, you should always double-check with someone
who probably knows more than I do&hellip; which is a lot of people. These are just a few simple ideas that probably
work best only at home, personal social medias, etc.</p>

<h1>The Tips:</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some simple password stuff.</p>

<h3>1. Don&rsquo;t use the same password everywhere</h3>

<p>This is both simple and difficult. It&rsquo;s highly recommended that you <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the same password for everything.
Some (most) people will use the same password, or a simple variation of the same passwords over and over and over
again. This is not a good. Even if your password is something like <em>Ith!nkTrUd3e@asW1fe1sHOT!?%$</em> (which is a strong
password I should add, but more on that later) using it on every platform you use is not smart.</p>

<p>See, web developers, programmers, and IT companies are only human. However, the weakest link in any organization&rsquo;s
security policy is <em>always</em> the humans. We make mistakes. It&rsquo;s normal. But sometimes humans make mistakes where your
personal details get hacked or breached and get added to these wordlists that get sold on the darkweb. It&rsquo;s fairly
common practice that your passwords will be stored as a hash value for security purposes but sometimes they&rsquo;re not.
Sometimes our passwords get out into the wild in other ways too so maybe that&rsquo;ll be a future blog post?</p>

<p>Anyway, the long and short of it is to try and use different passwords for EVERY account you use so that if one of
your passwords get sold to a bad guy then at least it&rsquo;s just one account that&rsquo;s been breached and not your entire
life. This way if your password to Facebook gets stolen then it won&rsquo;t affect your email account or worse - your bank
account.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;m going to look into using some day soon is a <em>password manager.</em> Look it up. You might like it if you&rsquo;re
more paranoid than I am.</p>

<p>Also, on the topic of &ldquo;breaches,&rdquo; you should check out <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned.com</a>
and see if your email has been involved in any breaches. I checked one of mine recently and it looks like I was
breached when Dubsmash got hacked a few years ago. Cool. But not really.</p>

<h3>2. Strong passwords</h3>

<p>This should go without saying but unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t - you need a strong password these days. Some websites and
services will make you create a strong password while registering but unfortunately a lot of services and sites don&rsquo;t
have a strong enough password policy. In fact, instead of using pass<em>words</em> we should be using pass<em>phrases</em>. If your
password to your email is still <strong>password</strong> or <strong>password123</strong> or <strong>Passw0rd123</strong>, you need to change it&hellip; like 5
years ago.</p>

<p>Your password should contain a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters (i.e.
things like &ldquo;!&rdquo;, &ldquo;?&rdquo;, &ldquo;$&rdquo;, etc.). It should also be long. Like longer than you might think. Try 16 characters long,
if you can. Just because you think a human might not be able to guess your password does not mean that a computer
can&rsquo;t guess it. If you want to see how strong your password is and see how long it would take a computer to guess
your password, I recommend you check out this tool called <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">How Secure Is
My Password?</a> It&rsquo;ll give you a pretty good idea if your password is strong or not.</p>

<h3>3. A good anti-virus</h3>

<p>If you think that because your Windows 10 laptop comes pre-packaged with Windows Defender that you&rsquo;re safe - you&rsquo;re
not. It&rsquo;s a fair assumption though because, in reality, you would think that any anti-virus/anti-malware would do the
trick. It won&rsquo;t. Sorry.</p>

<p>So, before I continue, let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about malware. <strong>Malicious Software</strong> or as it&rsquo;s better known as
<strong>malware</strong> can be some nasty stuff. It can be anything from annoying adware that floods your computer with
advertisements to trojans that are trying to gain a backdoor to your computer to spyware that&rsquo;s trying to steal your
personal information like credit cards, social insurance numbers, etc. It&rsquo;s a very broad category that I might dive
into another time. But let&rsquo;s get this much straight: you really don&rsquo;t want any of it on your computer/device.</p>

<p>Another thing I need to address is that <strong>MacBooks and Apple devices are NOT virus-proof.</strong> This is a myth. Any
computer or device can get a virus. The reason that people think they don&rsquo;t get viruses though is because
approximately 90% of computer users are using Windows so therefore malware is written with Windows devices in mind.
However, there are a number of viruses and malware out there actively seeking to infect your MacBook. If you&rsquo;re a
Linux user, I probably don&rsquo;t need to go any further because IFYKYK.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far though and you are interested in something, you&rsquo;re best bet is to get one that you actually
have to pay for instead of a free one. Besides the obvious that it won&rsquo;t work as well, there&rsquo;s been cases where some
of these free ones will sell your information to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>My recommendation for a good anti-malware security system is <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/">BitDefender</a>.
Why? Because I actually use it. It provides a number of great options and it&rsquo;s always actively scanning a little bit,
especially when you&rsquo;re doing things like browsing the web or if you&rsquo;re an IT worker, it&rsquo;ll scan code you might be
looking at.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: I was once playing around with some malicious code I found in VSCode and never actually <em>saved</em>
the code to a file. Within seconds of pasting it to VSCode, BitDefender started yelling at me, telling me the code
was going to do bad things, and immediately put the code into a &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; so that it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my computer.</p>

<p>Aside from that though, it watches you while you&rsquo;re browsing the web and will block connections it things might not
be safe - like a good anti-virus should do.</p>

<p>The downside though (sort of) is that sometimes software you might be trying to install will get blocked and/or
blacklisted but this can be resolved if you know that it&rsquo;s actually safe - all you have to do is add the software to
an exception list.</p>

<h3>4. VPNs are for more than Netflix tampering</h3>

<p>Most people before the pandemic only knew about VPNs because they were trying to use them to gain access to things
like American Netflix (if you live in Canada) or some other country&rsquo;s list of Netflix (or other streaming service)
programs. These days with everyone working from home, most people know about them because it&rsquo;s how they link in to
their work.</p>

<p>A VPN though can be a powerful tool in your arsenal of cybersecurity tools though because it will protect your
private information and really anything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what happens: when you&rsquo;re on Netflix.com for example, every time you click a movie, or login, or go to a new
page you&rsquo;re sending a request directly to the Netflix server. When you use a VPN, your &ldquo;message&rdquo; to the Netflix
server is encrypted, or &ldquo;scrambled,&rdquo; and it is then sent to a VPN server where it is decrypted, or &ldquo;unscrambled,&rdquo; and
then sent to the Netflix server giving the server the idea that it is coming from the location of the VPN server
instead of the original user&rsquo;s computer or device. Because it is encrypted, this makes it impossible for someone
on the outside looking in to tell what you&rsquo;re requesting or where it is even supposed to be going giving you an added
piece of security to your arsenal and giving you more privacy in your browsing and Internet use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sort of bad for this but I don&rsquo;t always use one, except for work or things like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. But
this could be a &ldquo;do as I say, not as I do&rdquo; moment because if you&rsquo;re worried about Internet privacy, use a VPN.</p>

<h3>5. Change the default password on your router</h3>

<p>When you get your home WiFi hooked up, they usually give you a password to use to sign in. They&rsquo;ll also give you
a password for the browser-based router configuration where you can change things like your WiFi password, firewall
settings, etc. You&rsquo;re going to want to change this.</p>

<p>I actually found this out through practical experience where I was at a friend&rsquo;s house and he wanted me to help him
with his internet. So, naturally I opened the browser on my phone and typed in something like 192.168.0.1 to try and
change his settings with him. He didn&rsquo;t know the password for his router so I actually just Googled the router brand
and model and the first hit gave me the default username and password for logging on. It was just that easy. Had I
been a malicious actor, this could have been bad for him.</p>

<p>So yeah, just trust me on this.</p>

<h2>EDIT:</h2>

<p>I completely forgot about something and it&rsquo;s important. I&rsquo;m embarrassed to admit I forgot it, especially when I had
previously been thinking about it while writing this. Here it is:</p>

<h3>6. Update your devices!!!</h3>

<p>Yeah, so this is a big one. When your laptop or phone says there&rsquo;s an update, it&rsquo;s a really good idea to <strong>NOT</strong>
postpone these too long. I know they&rsquo;re an inconvenience, especially when it&rsquo;s a big update but a lot of times these
things are super important. Sometimes they&rsquo;re just the addition of a couple of cool emojis or a new layout for your
phone&rsquo;s homepage but more often than not they contain a security patch. Usually you can read what is being updated
but if you don&rsquo;t care for it, then just trust me and update your shit to avoid being breached.</p>

<p>And for those of you who think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing to hide so who cares?&rdquo; well I&rsquo;ve got news for you: we&rsquo;ve all got
stuff to hide. If you&rsquo;ve bought anything online, there is likely a record of it somewhere on your computer. There
could be credit card information on your devices or your social insurance number. Identity theft is on the rise these
days so it&rsquo;s important that you protect yourself from these things.</p>

<h3>7. Backups</h3>

<p>The last thing I&rsquo;ll mention (and admittedly also forgot) is to backup your devices. You can back them up locally but
that will serve you no good in the event your system crashes or you get hit by ransomeware.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a simple rule for doing backups and it&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;3-2-1 Backup Rule&rdquo; which means you should have at least
<strong>three</strong> copies of your backup with <strong>two</strong> copies stored on different devices or storage media (i.e. one on a cloud
and the other on an external hard drive or solid state drive) and <strong>one</strong> copy stored in a remote location.</p>

<p>Following this rule will effectively and efficiently allow you to restore your device(s) back to a functional state
in the event your device crashes or if you get hit by ransomware, which also allows you to save a few bucks and
actually guarantees that you&rsquo;ll get your files back unlike ransomware (just because you pay means squat).</p>

<p>I should also mention that you should do this at least weekly, in my opinion so that if something <em>does</em> happen,
you won&rsquo;t be stuck using a backup from a year ago. If that were to happen, you could be losing a year&rsquo;s worth of
data, photos of your kids, or just plain important stuff.</p>

<p>So start backing up your stuff too!</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There you have it. My first post and a little advice to get you started. Hopefully this will give you a little piece
of mind if you&rsquo;re a little concerned or just wanted to be a little more conscious of your Internet security and/or
privacy. Once again, please don&rsquo;t take my advice as official or anything of that sort. These are just a few thoughts
I had and thought I could share to maybe give someone a little help in their personal security measures.</p>
